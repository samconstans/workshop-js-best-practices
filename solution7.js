 ## Verify Your Full Vending Machine Implementation (Exercise 8 of 8)

 # Verify Vending Machine

 Now that we've decomposed our initial JavaScript file into three separate,
 self-contained classes, we should finally test the remaining methods that
 act as the entry points into these classes' functionality. In practice,
 you should always delegate specific functionality to its own service and
 have a controller like vendingMachine.js orchestrate all the work that
 these services do. If all has gone well, the only thing you should have to
 do in this exercise is replace any this references with references to the
 classes that call the methods.
